<p class="paragraph">
  I'm a CS student at Portland State University.
  I do *nix sys-admin work for the <a href="http://cat.pdx.edu">CAT</a> at <a href="http://pdx.edu">PSU</a> (Portland).

  My online handle is usually <a href="http://google.com/search?q=nightfly19">nightfly19</a>,
  though I prefer nightfly and I'll take it whenever it's available.
  Sagenite.net was partially chosen as a sort of mnemonic that could help bridge my professional identity,
  and my online identity.
